#  Set Card Game

This is a SwiftUI implementation of [Set card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)). I made this implementation by considering [Stanford University's SwiftUI Course](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu)'s [programming assignment 3](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_3_0.pdf). I mostly stick to the assignment but I have added animation for dealing cards and unit tests for view model as an extra. And I want to add the features mentioned in the extra credits in the assignment in the future.

#### Note
[Assignment 4](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_4_0.pdf) is also about this game and it is about adding animations to the game. I have added this assignment's requirements with [this PR](https://github.com/ibrahimcetin/SetCardGame/pull/1).
